usage: _test.py [-h] [-u USERNAME] [-c] [-r] [-a] [-d DAYS] [start_dir]

positional arguments:
  start_dir             The directory to scan. Defaults to the current working
                        directory if unspecified

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Limit the scan to commits by this username. If
                        unspecified, the username set in the global git config
                        file (if present) is used. If no username is given by
                        either of these methods, or if the -c option is
                        passed, all commits are considered regardless of
                        author
  -c, --all-commits     Consider all commits by any user. Overrides the
                        --username option if present.
  -r, --recursive       If no repository is found in the given directory,
                        search all subdirectories recursively and consider any
                        repositories found there. If the top level directory
                        is a repository, this does nothing.
  -a, --all             Start the scan in the home directory, and search all
                        subdirectories for repositories. Same as 'linelog ~
                        -r'
  -d DAYS, --days DAYS  The number of days in the past to traverse when
                        scanning a repository for relevant commits. If
                        unspecified defaults to 1 (only today). The output
                        graph is only generated if this is greater than one
